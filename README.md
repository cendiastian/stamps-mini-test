# Stampsindo Mini Test - Software Engineer

This repository contains my solutions for the Stampsindo Mini Test as part of the selection process for the Software Engineer position. It includes the implementation of two tasks: foobarArray.js and forecast.

## File Descriptions

1. `foobarArray.js`: This file contains the solution for Task 1. It is a JavaScript program that performs a specific operation on an array of numbers called "foobar array". The program outputs the modified array based on the given rules in the task description.

2. `forecast.js`: This file contains the solution for Task 2. It is a JavaScript program that fetches weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the Axios module. The program retrieves the weather forecast for a specific location and prints the temperature and weather condition for each day.

## Usage

1. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the command `git clone [Repository URL]` in the terminal or by using the clone feature in a Git GUI.

2. Task 1 - foobarArray.js:
   - Open the `foobarArray.js` file to view the JavaScript code for Task 1.
   - The program takes an input array containing numbers from 1 to 100 and modifies the array based on the specified rules.
   - Run the program in a JavaScript runtime environment to see the modified array as the output.

3. Task 2 - forecast:
   - Open the `forecast.js` file to view the JavaScript code for Task 2.
   - The program uses the Axios module and the dotenv module.
   - Before running the program, make sure you have the required modules installed by running `npm install` in your terminal.
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenWeatherMap API key as `API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`.
   - Modify the `location` variable in the code to specify the desired location for the weather forecast.
   - Run the program in a JavaScript runtime environment to see the weather forecast output.

## Modules Used

- `axios`: A popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests. It is used in the `forecast.js` file to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- `dotenv`: A module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. It is used in the `forecast.js` file to load the API key from the `.env` file.

## Output Folder

The `output` folder contains the output files generated by running the respective tasks.

- `programKecil.png`: This file contains the output generated by running the foobarArray.js program.

- `forecast.png`: This file contains the output generated by running the forecast.js program.

## Notes

- Make sure to have Node.js installed on your machine to run the JavaScript programs.
- Refer to the comments within the code for additional explanations and instructions.
- For any questions or clarifications regarding the solutions, please feel free to contact me.

Good luck with your evaluation process!

Thank you,
